'@xstate/vue': minor
---

Added support for Vue 3 that has builtin support for the composition API. This means that this package will no longer work with [`@vue/composition-api`](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api) package. If you are still using Vue 2 you should continue using `@xstate/vue@^0.3.0`.
